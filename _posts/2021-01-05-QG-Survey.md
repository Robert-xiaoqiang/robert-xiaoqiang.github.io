# QG Survey

## Overview

This post mainly consists of papers on Question Generation (QG) from ACL'20 and controllable diversity.

## Learn from Your Neighbor: Learning Multimodal Mapping from Sparse Annotations

### Summary & Intuitions

- place not penalization but brief on plausible predictions
- inspired by semi-supervised learning, annotated neighbors are important signals for diversity
- neighbor definition and neighbor penalization

### Contributions

- neighbor definition: semantic space and distance metrics (similarity)
- neighbor penalization:
  - label-missing multi-label (or multi-way) classification: similarity as loss weight
  - sequence generation from image or text input:
    - overall weight: similarity from double inputs
    - current token attends neighbor input for: (address the issue of unrelated visual objects and semantic tokens)
      - token-wise weight
      - modulated sequence generation of neighbors (language attention)
      - choose image region or feature (visual attention)
    - note: non-trivial derivatives of weights is necessary
