##### SSL Survey

We are on the cusp of a major research revolution, which is made by deep learning. In my perspective, there two outstanding contributions on the network architecture in this revolution. They are $\textit{ResNet}$ and $Transformer$. As the research exploration continues to deepen and especially the increase of computational capacity, the technology using unlabeled data attracts more and more concentrations. There is no doubt that the **self-supervised learning (SSL)** is a direction deserve diving into. Therefore, this post will focus survey the cutting-edge development of SSL from the following aspects: theory guarantee, image SSL, sequence SSL and graph SSL.
